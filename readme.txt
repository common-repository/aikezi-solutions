= Can i fill HTML, CSS, PHP... code in the form? =

Aikezi Solutions is not designed to support code snippets like php, html, css... In some cases you can use them. However, it may not display as you expect.

= What languages can I use to fill out the form? =
The Aikezi Solutions plugin can support all form filling languages. This is untested, so if using your language causes an error, let us know so we can fix it.
Make sure that the browser you are using also supports that language before jumping to conclusions

= How to use shortcodes? =
Use the shortcode [aikezi_info] to display all the information.

If you want custom display use the shortcode [aikezi_info id="info id"] with comma separated info id.

To display the image, use the shortcode: [aikezi_info_photo]

We recommend entering plain text. You should not use html, css or php code, etc. may cause unexpected errors. Enter less than 75 characters for the Label and less than 150 characters for the Body. Do not use the "|" sign. signal. signal.
